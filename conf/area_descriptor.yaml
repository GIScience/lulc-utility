area:
  # There are two ways to provide the area of interest (AOI) for the dataset computation: as a file or as a name
  # corresponding to an OSM boundary.
  # If both are provided, the file will be prioritized over the name.

  # Option 1. File: AOI can be provided as a filepath, with an optional id column
#  aoi_file: data/regierungsbezirk_karlsruhe.geojson
  aoi_file: data/sample_study_cities_Poland_Germany.geojson
  aoi_id_col: osm_id

  # Optionally, provide ids to filter the aoi_file by (will be ignored if not present in the aoi_file)
